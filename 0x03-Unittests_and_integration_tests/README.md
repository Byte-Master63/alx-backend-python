# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

> This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. The goal is to learn how to write unit and integration tests for Python code, improving code reliability and maintainability.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the importance of testing in software development.
- Write unit tests using Python’s `unittest` module.
- Mock external dependencies using `unittest.mock`.
- Write integration tests to validate multiple parts of the application working together.
- Differentiate between unit and integration testing.
- Use patching to mock behaviors and responses.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **Python 3.8+**
- Testing: `unittest`, `unittest.mock`
- Linter: `pycodestyle` (PEP8)
